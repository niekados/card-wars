# Card Wars

Card Wars is a simple card game that brings back memories of my childhood. It was the first card game I learned to play, and it quickly became my favourite. It's easy to learn with basic rules, and matches can be very entertaining, although they can last an eternity. I want to recreate my childhood experience for myself and to share it with others, especially with little ones! It can be challenging to find an adult opponent with the patience or a parent with the time to play these lengthy matches with their children, so why not entrust this task to the most patient opponent of all - the computer!

## Game Rules

**Objective:**
- To win all the cards by the end of the game.

**Setup:**
- Each player has a separate deck of cards. Black cards are dealt to one player and red cards to the other.

**Gameplay:**
- Players take turns flipping over one card at a time from the top of their decks and placing them face-up in the middle of the playing area.
- The player with the higher card wins the round. If both cards are of the same value, it results in a "war."
- In the case of a war, each player places another set of cards face-up over the cards in the war.
- In case the cards are equal again, another "war" happens on top of the cards already in the war.
- The player who wins the war collects all the face-up cards in the middle of the playing area and places them at the bottom of their deck.
- If a player runs out of cards during a war, they lose the game. Otherwise, the game continues until one player wins all the cards.
